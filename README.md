# zmk-xiao-ble-corne
Welcome, this is a forked repo for the firmware for a crkbd sold by a few vendors on AliExpress. 

The keyboard in question is designed by Jon Muller, has the text "Abomination v.1.2" written on it and uses the xiao-ble controller.

It might have a screen on some versions, mine does not yet, even though the vendor said it would.

Please visit the original repository and give Jon the kudos he deserves...
