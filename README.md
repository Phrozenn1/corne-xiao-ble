# zmk-xiao-ble-corne
Welcome, this is a forked repo for the firmware for a crkbd sold by a few vendors on AliExpress.

The original repository has not been updated in over a year, but I will keep updating this fork for as long as I own the keyboard.

The main branch has a default Qwerty layout and is less frequently updated, but as I use ColemakDH I update that branch quite often.

The keyboard in question is designed by Jon Muller, has the text "Abomination v.1.2" written on it and uses the xiao-ble controller.

It might have a screen on some versions, mine does not yet, even though the vendor said it would.

Please visit the original repository and give Jon the kudos he deserves...
